# 1.0 Introduction

Built on the proven BeagleBoard.org速 open source Linux approach, BeagleBone速 AI fills the gap between small SBCs and more powerful industrial computers. Based on the Texas Instruments AM5729, developers have access to the powerful SoC with the ease of BeagleBone速 Black header and mechanical compatibility. BeagleBone速 AI makes it easy to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in everyday life via TI C66x digital-signal-processor (DSP) cores and embedded-vision-engine (EVE) cores supported through an optimized TIDL machine learning OpenCL API with pre-installed tools. Focused on everyday automation in industrial, commercial and home applications.

# 2.0 Change History

### 2.1 Document Change History

### 2.2 Board changes

#### 2.2.1 Rev A0
Initial prototype revision. Not taken to production.

#### 2.2.2 Rev A1
Second round prototype.
* Fixed size of mounting holes.
* Added LED for WiFi status.
* Added microHDMI.
* Changed eMMC voltage from 3.3V to 1.8V to support HS200.
* Changed eMMC from 4GB to 16GB.
* Changed serial debug header from 6-pin 100mil pitch to 3-pin 1.5mm pitch.
* Switched expansion header from UART4 to UART5. The UART4 pins were used for the microHDMI.

#### 2.2.3 Rev A1a
Pilot run.
* Added pull-down resistor on serial debug header RX line.

#### 2.2.4 Rev A2
Proposed changes.
* Moved microSD card cage closer to microHDMI to fit cases better.
* Connected AM5729 ball AB10 to to P9.13 to provide a GPIO.
* HDMI hot-plug detection fixes planned (TBD).
